            Goccia is the first magazine for Communication Design’s course made
            by and for students. It is a project with an independent and
            multi-disciplinar approach which tries to represent the intellectual
            vivacity of our course and the discipline in general. The focal
            point of the entire project is a periodical theme which is developed
            transmedially in all the artifact system of Goccia: a physical copy
            of the magazine and a digital touchpoint in which the the theme is
            furthermore explored. Goccia's meta-projectual core is constitued by
            values such as his “democratic nature, customization and immediacy”.
            These value are incarnated in featueres like the participation and
            interaction with users and the observational approach by which the
            theme is selected.. The whole identity is based on the concept of
            fluid which sort of incorporates all the other values. We could
            resume Goccia as an attempt to catch and represent through the
            Politecnico community the Graphic Design's zeitgeist, periodically.
          </p>
          <p class="unselectable">
            The identity consists in few key elements: name, logo, payoff, main
            font. The name Goccia refers to “bosco La Goccia” an abandoned
            ex-industrial area, now contamined by nature. In this case the name
            Goccia, meaning “Drop”, is a reference also to the fluid identity
            and approach of the magazine and to his capacity of “being
            contaminated” in the same way the physical place has been
            contaminated by plants. The logo, smooth and also fluid, is made
            only by a capital G coming from the experimental open-source font
            Pilowlava designed by Velvetyne typography. With its simplicity it
            allows various declinations or “contaminations”. The payoff
            re-proposes the concept of fluidity in an explicit manner. Ending
            the indentity section, there is Monument Extended (by Pangram
            Pangram), the only fixed font for all the artifacts system. In fact
            elements like typography, colour or texture are not fixed, but vary
            in relation to the theme. The addition of other fonts for instance
            has to be conducted coherently with the theme of each number of
            Goccia, inside each semestral publication. Each theme is the result
            of an observation on main social platforms of the latest graphic
            tendencies. Then the redaction selects a keyword representing better
            the underlying theoresis of the tendency, its speculative core. In
            this case, observing the latest wide-spreaded half-robotics
            half-human graphics, the keyword that came out from the dialogue was
            "post-human". We talk about a tendency which has its artistic origin
            in ’70 and ‘80 sci-fi movies and especially in a ’90 contemporary
            art movement.
          </p>
          <p class="unselectable">
            We divided the magazine in three sections. The first shows
            curatorial contents like an historical Background, interviews to
            emerging designers and artists, technical focuses on typography
            related to the theme. I wrote down the Background part, which
            represents the cultural and artistic development of the theme. For
            example I have not limited its origin in well-known sci-fi movies
            and novels like Asimov’s ones. The goal was to go deeper in the
            speculation, showing links to humanistic art and post-renaissance
            artists like Hieronymus Bosch. Then in the other articles there is
            certainly a more contemporary-oriented focus. The core of the
            magazine is a sequence of the personal redaction members’
            interpretation of the theme. That is carried out in a
            multi-disciplinar manner as each member of the redaction tries to
            give out his personal free-form interpretation. So we made both the
            container and the content. Mine is “Scenari Post-Ludici”, a
            photographic and graphic artifact which reflect of the way we
            approach playing latest video games and the influence of
            competitiveness (e-sports) on it. We tried to expand the borders of
            contribution with an entire section dedicated to user-generated
            contents. The last section is in fact a collection of all the
            contributions that have been sent to us by design students of
            Politecnico di Milano. They’re all interpretations of the theme but
            this time without a comment which gives them a conceptual coherence.
            In this way every design enthusiast can use our zine as a showcase
            for his work, while we benefit of their interest which generates
            awareness the brand through partecipation.
          </p>
          <p class="unselectable">
            The non-fixed identity of the magazine consists in a variation of
            few visual features. For instance, in the cover, there is always the
            logo overlying a thematic texture. The logo always interacts with
            the texture. In the case of Goccia #00 (Post-human) the logo has
            been rendered in wireframe on an organic texture, representing the
            interaction of technology and biology in the Post-human speculation
            and visual tendency. In the cover beside there the logo interacts
            with a tropical leaf in the number #01 (not entirely designed) with
            the theme of “Exotic”. In the image below there is an example of the
            declination of the internal graphic features, specifically the ones
            of “Flusso” middle section. The progression and interaction of
            images and text is fixed but colour, background texture and
            typography vary from the #00 number.

            @goccia.mag on Instagram is not only a touchpoint with the audience.
            It is a trans-medial editorial space which brings furthermore the
            narration of the magazine. The tone-of-voice of all copywriting is
            ironical and engaging. We determined various formats like “Indizi”
            to give indications of the next theme and to generate curiosity in
            it. That in particular is combined with a guerrilla marketing action
            with stickers of the “Indizio” spread around the whole campus. We
            make interaction with the audience reposting the ones that finds the
            sticker. Other formats like “Contagocce”, following the publication,
            expand directly the contents of the printed copy of the magazine.
            Instagram profile is also a platform which permits, with its
            in-evidence stories, the spreading of our brief for user’s
            contribution. It provides them with a moodboard and an explicit
            definition of what the current number is going to talk about.
